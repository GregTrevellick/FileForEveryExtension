# Files For Every Suffix

A C# .Net console app that will populate a directory with approx 70,000 tiny files (2 x 26 x 26 x 26 x 2), each with a unique suffix, resulting in files on your file system such as xxx.AAA, xxx.AAB, xxx.AAC through to xxx.ZZZ.

Who needs this ?
* Anyone who needs a big variety of file types but hasn't the time to create by hand.
* Developers who need files of many different types, typically for edge-case testing of code.
* May be of benefit to authors of certain types of Visual Studio extensions.
* Anyone who wants to see the associated file icon and/or program for every type of file on their system.
* Me.

Why did I create this ?
* I was writing a Visual Studio extension which needed many different file types for the purposes of testing it - that was the brain child.
* Once the brain child was conceived it immediately occured that anyone writing certain VS extensions could leverage a folder full of a variety of extensions (e.g. testing of [Open in Visual Sublime Text](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/384892a5-7b67-42f2-b7de-574ef254a02a "Open in Sublime Text") or [File Icons](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5e1762e8-a88b-417c-8467-6a65d771cc4e "File Icons") extensions).
* As a relatively simply project this was a perfect candidate for my first open source project.

# Features

Files will be generated by this app  in a folder called 'Files' with two sub-folders, called 'ByLetter' and 'All35K'. 

'ByLetter' contains approx 35k files, broken down into separate folders per letter of the alphabet. Each folder therefore contains approx 1,300 files. 

'All35K' contains the exact same 35k files, but in a single folder rather than segregated by initial letter. This may mean that opening this folder on some systems may be relatively slow.

I offer both folders for a variety of use-cases, which I won't even pretend to anticipate.

Special case handling for the content of the following file types (ensure content is valid for a Visual studio build):
* .EDMX
* .LICX
* .RESX
